Notes:

Starting the server:
- The server is started by running the compiled file from the command line, with an additional argument, the port number to run on.  
- For example, if the compiled file is called `output`, then to run the server you would type `./output 8000`.

Sending requests:
- Requests are sent to the server as HTTP requests.  These can be sent by a browser or telnet.  The address in the request should be the loopback address (127.0.0.1), and the port number is the one specified when running the server.
- For example, in the browser you would visit `127.0.0.1:8000/index.html`
- Or to run in telnet, start telnet from the command line with `telnet 127.0.0.1 8000` and then enter the request `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`.
